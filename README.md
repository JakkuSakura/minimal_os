# Minimal OS
Minimal OS is what I do for deeper understanding of Operating System, especially when COMP 3511 in HKUST is too simple for me.

It is currently minimal, and will be minimal as possible in the foreseeable future.

I am basically following [blog_os's awesome tutorial](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os) as time of writing. However, the tutorial takes long time to update.
